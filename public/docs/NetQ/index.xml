      <description>Monitor Switches With the NetQ UI, you can monitor individual switches separately from the network. You are able to view the various components deployed for all switches in the network. Being able to monitor switch component inventory aids in upgrade, compliance, and other planning tasks.
For network-wide monitoring, refer to Monitor the Network.

      <description>Monitor Network Health As with any network, one of the challenges is keeping track of all of the moving parts. With the NetQ GUI, you can view the overall health of your network at a glance and then delve deeper for periodic checks or as conditions arise that require attention. For a general understanding of how well your network is operating, the Network Health card workflow is the best place to start as it contains the highest view and performance rollups.</description>

      <description>Monitor Network Inventory With NetQ, a network administrator can monitor both the switch hardware and its operating system for misconfigurations or misbehaving services. The Devices Inventory card workflow provides a view into the switches and hosts installed in your network and their various hardware and software components. The workflow contains a small card with a count of each device type in your network, a medium card displaying the operating systems running on each set of devices, large cards with component information statistics, and full-screen cards displaying tables with attributes of all switches and all hosts in your network.</description>

      <description>NetQ User Interface Overview The NetQ 2.0.0 graphical user interface (UI) enables you to access NetQ capabilities through a web browser as opposed to through a terminal window using the Command Line Interface (CLI). Visual representations of the health of the network, inventory, and system events make it easy to both find faults and misconfigurations and to fix them. The UI is supported on Google Chrome. Other popular browsers may be used, but have not been tested and may have some presentation issues.</description>

      <description>NetQ Command Line Overview The NetQ CLI provides access to all of the network state and event information collected by the NetQ Agents. It behaves the same way most CLIs behave, with groups of commands used to display related information, the ability to use TAB completion when entering commands, and to get help for given commands and options. The commands are grouped into four categories: check and show, agent and notifier, trace, and resolve.</description>

      <description>Monitor Container Environments The NetQ Agent monitors container environments the same way it monitors physical servers. There is no special implementation. The NetQ Agent pulls data from the container as it would pull data from a Cumulus Linux switch or Linux host. It can be installed on a Linux server or in a Linux VM. NetQ Agent integrates with container orchestrators including Kubernetes and Docker Swarm.
NetQ monitors many aspects of containers on your network, including their:</description>

The NetQ Agent is supported on the following Linux hosts:
 CentOS 7 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 Ubuntu 16.04  You need to install the OS-specific NetQ metapack on every host you want to monitor with NetQ.</description>

In this release, you can monitor the network-wide behavior or a single session of the BGP, EVPN, MLAG, and LLDP services. Each protocol has its own card workflow containing:
 a small card with an overall status,  a medium card displaying key attributes of the protocol,  a large card with detailed performance statistics, some with additional tabs, and  full screen cards displaying attributes of all associated switches, sessions, alarms or other relevant data.</description>

 What switches do I have in the network?
 Are all switches licensed correctly?
 Do all switches have NetQ agents running?
  NetQ uses LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) to collect port information. NetQ can also identify peer ports connected to DACs (Direct Attached Cables) and AOCs (Active Optical Cables) without using LLDP, even if the link is not UP.</description>

NetQ can monitor many aspects of an MLAG configuration, including:
 Verifying the current state of all nodes Verifying the dual connectivity state Checking that the peer link is part of the bridge Verifying whether MLAG bonds are not bridge members Verifying whether the VXLAN interface is not a bridge member Checking for remote-side service failures caused by systemctl Checking for VLAN-VNI mapping mismatches Checking for layer 3 MTU mismatches on peerlink subinterfaces Checking for VXLAN active-active address inconsistencies Verifying that STP priorities are the same across both peers  Contents {.</description>

      <description>Investigate NetQ Issues There are several paths you can take to locate and investigate issues that occur in the NetQ software itself, including viewing configuration and log files, verifying NetQ Agent health, and verifying NetQ Platform configuration. If these do not produce a resolution, you can capture a log to use in discussion with Cumulus Networks support team.

      <description>Methods for Diagnosing Network Issues NetQ provides users with the ability to go back in time to replay the network state, see fabric-wide event change logs and root cause state deviations. The NetQ Telemetry Server maintains data collected by NetQ agents in a time-series database, making fabric-wide events available for analysis. This enables you to replay and analyze network-wide events for better visibility and to correlate patterns. This allows for root-cause analysis and optimization of network configs for the future.</description>

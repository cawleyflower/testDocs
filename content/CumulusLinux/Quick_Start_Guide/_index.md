# Quick Start Guide

This quick start guide provides an end-to-end setup process for
installing and running Cumulus Linux, as well as a collection of example
commands for getting started after installation is complete.

{{%notice info%}}

Intermediate-level Linux knowledge is assumed for this guide. You should
be familiar with basic text editing, Unix file permissions, and process
monitoring. A variety of text editors are pre-installed, including `vi`
and `nano`.

You must have access to a Linux or UNIX shell. If you are running
Windows, use a Linux environment like [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/)
as your command line tool for interacting with Cumulus Linux.

If you are a networking engineer but are unfamiliar with Linux concepts,
refer to [this reference
guide](https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/201787636)
to compare the Cumulus Linux CLI and configuration options, and their
equivalent Cisco Nexus 3000 NX-OS commands and settings. You can also
[watch a series of short
videos](http://cumulusnetworks.com/technical-videos/) introducing you to
Linux and Cumulus Linux-specific concepts.

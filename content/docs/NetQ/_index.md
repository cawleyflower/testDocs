# NETQ20DRAFT (Cumulus NetQ 2.0 Early Access)
Cumulus® NetQ is a network operations tool set that provides actionable insight into and operational intelligence about the health of the entire Linux-based data center — from the container, virtual machine, or host, all the way to the switch and port. Working hand-in-hand with Cumulus Linux, NetQ enables organizations to validate network state, both during regular operations and for post-mortem diagnostic analysis. Running on Cumulus Linux switches and other certified systems — such as Ubuntu®, Red Hat®, and CentOS hosts — NetQ captures network data and other state information in real time, providing cloud architects and network operations teams the ability to operate with visibility into the entire network. It is integrated with container orchestrators and the Netlink interface to make this happen. With NetQ, network operations changes from a manual, reactive, box-by-box approach to an automated, informed and agile one.

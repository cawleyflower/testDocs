# Monitor Informational Events

Two event workflows, the Alarms card workflow and the Info card
workflow, provide a view into the events occurring in the network. The
Alarms card workflow tracks critical severity events, whereas the Info
card workflow tracks all warning, info, and debug severity events.

To focus on events from a single device perspective, refer to [Monitor
Switches](Monitor_Switches). To monitor alarms, refer to [Monitor Alarm
Events](Monitor_Alarm_Events).

## Info Card Workflow Summary

The Info card workflow enables users to easily view and track
informational alarms occurring anywhere in your network.

The small Info card displays:

  - total number and distribution of info events

  - total number and distribution of alarms

The medium Info card displays:

  - types of info events that occurred

  - total number and distribution of info events

  - total number and distribution of alarms

The large Alarms card displays:

  - types of info events that occurred

  - total number and distribution of info events

  - total number and distribution of alarms

  - info events by most recent

  - devices by most issues

The full screen Info card provides tabs for all
events.

## View Info Events Summary

A summary of the informational events occurring in the network can be
found on the small, medium, and large Info cards. Additional details are
available as you increase the size of the card.

To view the summary with the *small* Info card, simply open the card.
This card gives you a high-level view in a condensed visual, including
the number and distribution of the info events along with the alarms
that have occurred during the same time
period.

To view the summary with the *medium* Info card, simply open the card.
This card gives you the same count and distribution of info and alarm
events, but it also provides information about the sources of the info
events and enables you to view a small slice of time using the
distribution
charts.

Use the chart at the top of the card to view the various sources, types,
of info events. The four or so types with the most info events are
called out separately, with all others collected together into an
*Other*
category.

To view the summary with the large Info card, open the card. The left
side of the card provides the same capabilities as the medium Info
card.

<div id="src-9012102_MonitorInformationalEvents-CompareTimingofInfoandAlarmEvents" class="section section-1">

## Compare Timing of Info and Alarm Events

While you can see the relative relationship between info and alarm
events on the small Info card, the medium and large cards provide
considerably more information. Open either of these to view individual
line charts for the events. Generally, alarms have some corollary info
events. For example, when a network service becomes unavailable, a
critical alarm is often issued, and when the service becomes available
again, an info event of severity warning is generated. For this reason,
you might see some level of tracking between the info and alarm counts
and distributions. Some other possible scenarios:

  - When a critical alarm is resolved, you may see a temporary increase
    in info events as a result.

  - When you get a burst of info events, you may see a follow-on
    increase in critical alarms, as the info events may have been
    warning you of something beginning to go wrong.

  - You set logging to debug, and a large number of info events of
    severity debug are seen. You would not expect to see an increase in
    critical
alarms.

<div id="src-9012102_MonitorInformationalEvents-ViewAllInfoEventsSortedbyTimeofOccurrence" class="section section-1">

## View All Info Events Sorted by Time of Occurrence

You can view all info events using the large Info card. Open the large
card and confirm the **Events By Most Recent** option is selected in the
dropdown above the table on the right. When this option is selected, all
of the info events are listed with the most recently occurring event at
the top. Scrolling down shows you the info events that have occurred at
an earlier time within the selected time period for the
card.

## View Devices with the Most Info Events

You can filter instead for the devices that have the most info events by
selecting the **Devices by Event Count** option from the dropdown above
the
table.

<div id="src-9012102_MonitorInformationalEvents-ViewAllEvents" class="section section-1">

## View All Events

You can view all events in the network either by clicking the **Show All
Events** link under the table on the large Info Events card, or by
opening the full screen Info Events
card.

## Informational Events Reference

The following table lists alarm messages organized by message type and
then severity, by default. Click the column header to sort the list by
that characteristic. Click

in any column header to toggle the sort order between A-Z and Z-A.
Recommended actions suggest NetQ GUI cards, CLI commands and Cumulus
Linux NCLU commands for further investigation.

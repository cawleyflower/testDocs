# Cumulus NetQ UI User Guide

This guide is intended for network administrators and operators who are
responsible for monitoring and troubleshooting the network in their data
center environment. NetQ 2.0 offers the ability to easily monitor and
manage your data center network infrastructure and operational health.
This guide provides instructions and information about monitoring both
individual components of the network, as well as the network as a whole,
and the NetQ software itself using the NetQ graphical user interface
(GUI). If you prefer to use a command line interface, refer to the
Cumulus NetQ CLI User Guide .

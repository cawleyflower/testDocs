## What's New in Cumulus NetQ 2.0

**Cumulus NetQ 2.0.1** includes the following new and updated features:

  - Added
    
      - UI: Ability to monitor all BGP, MLAG, EVPN, and LLDP sessions
        network-wide. (This was already available in the CLI.)
    
      - API: Included BGP, MLAG, EVPN and LLDP network services APIs in
        swagger.json file

**Cumulus NetQ 2.0.0** includes the following new and updated features:

  - Added
    
      - Modern cloud-based infrastructure enables scalable and agile
        network with real-time data collection
        
          - Graphical User Interface (UI) provides a visual
            representation of the network devices and eventsMonitor
            network-wide health
        
          - Monitor individual device health and configuration
        
          - View network devices inventory and device component
            inventory
        
          - Track alarms and informational events across the network and
            for individual devices and components, protocols and
            services
        
          - Customize your own monitoring workbench to meet your needs
    
      - RESTful API provides access to data for use in third-party
        analytic tools
    
      - NetQ Appliance with the NetQ Platform pre-installed to speed
        deployment and get monitoring as quickly as possible

  - Updated
    
      - Instead of using the `netq show` commands to display changes
        between two points in time, a new `netq``  show events ` command
        is available to see these changes.
    
      - The `netq config ts` commands used to configure the Telemetry
        Server has been deprecated. `netq config` commands remain for
        local file-based configuration and `netq notification` commands
        have been added for configuring event notifications.
    
      - Timestamps which indicate when a change occurred are displayed
        as an absolute time (Mon Feb 4 07:23:18 2019) versus relative to
        the current time (0d:2h:58m:34s ago). Uptimes remain relative to
        the current time.

The following features have been deprecated in the 2.0 release:

  - The early access features provided with NetQ 1.4 that were not fully
    productized are not available with this release.
    
      - Extension of NetQ CLI with custom commands
    
      - NetQL, query language for directly accessing the database. This
        data will be available through the NetQ UI or API over time.
    
      - Export of interface statistics to third-party analytics tools
        (like Grafana). This data will be available through the NetQ UI
        or API over time.
    
      - Image and Provisioning Management (IPM) application. Life cycle
        management is in development for a future release.

  - Support for Docker and Docker Swarm. Use Kubernetes instead.

  - `netq-shell` command. A subset of NetQ commands had to be run on the
    Telemetry Server. There is no longer a Telemetry server in the NetQ
    2.0 architectureâ€“multiple services are now responsible for this
    functionality. Commands that ran on the Telemetry Server have been
    removed and the replacement commands can be run from any node.

  - Service Console. Web-based UI access to the CLI is not currently
    available. Access the CLI directly through a terminal
window.

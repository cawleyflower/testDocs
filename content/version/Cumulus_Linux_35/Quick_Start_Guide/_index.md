This quick start guide provides an end-to-end setup process for
installing and running Cumulus Linux, as well as a collection of example
commands for getting started once installation is complete.

{{%notice info%}}

Prior intermediate Linux knowledge is assumed for this guide. You should
be familiar with basic text editing, Unix file permissions, and process
monitoring. A variety of text editors are pre-installed, including `vi`
and `nano`.

You must have access to a Linux or UNIX shell. If you are running
Windows, you should use a Linux environment like
[Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) as your command line tool for
interacting with Cumulus Linux.

If you're a networking engineer but are unfamiliar with Linux concepts,
refer to [this reference
guide](https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/201787636)
for examples of the Cumulus Linux CLI and configuration options, and
their equivalent Cisco Nexus 3000 NX-OS commands and settings for
comparison. You can also [watch a series of short
videos](http://cumulusnetworks.com/technical-videos/) introducing you to
Linux in general and some Cumulus Linux-specific concepts in particular.

Spanning tree protocol (STP) is always recommended in layer 2
topologies, as it prevents bridge loops and broadcast radiation on a
bridged network.

The `mstpd` daemon is an open source project used by Cumulus Linux to
implement IEEE802.1D 2004 and IEEE802.1Q 2011. `mstpctl` is the utility
provided by the `mstpd` service to configure STP. STP is disabled by
default on bridges in Cumulus Linux.

## Commands

  - brctl

  - mstpctl

## Supported Modes

The STP modes Cumulus Linux supports vary depending upon whether the
[traditional or VLAN-aware bridge driver
mode](/Ethernet_Bridging_-_VLANs.html) is in use.

For a bridge configured in *traditional* mode, PVST and PVRST are
supported, with the default set to PVRST. Each traditional bridge has
its own separate STP instance.

Bridges configured in
*[VLAN-aware](/VLAN-aware_Bridge_Mode_for_Large-scale_Layer_2_Environments.html)*
mode operate **only** in RSTP mode.

## Configuring STP within a VLAN-aware Bridge

*[VLAN-aware](/VLAN-aware_Bridge_Mode_for_Large-scale_Layer_2_Environments.html)*
bridges only operate in RSTP mode. STP BPDUs are transmitted on the
native VLAN.

If a bridge running RSTP (802.1w) receives a common STP (802.1D) BPDU,
it will automatically fall back to 802.1D operation.

### Creating a VLAN-aware Bridge and Configuring RSTP

To create a VLAN-aware mode bridge, configure the bridge stanza under
`/etc/network/interfaces`.

``` 
                   
auto br2
iface br2
  bridge-vlan-aware yes
  bridge-vids 100
  bridge-pvid  1
  bridge-ports swp1 swp4 swp5
  bridge-stp on
   
    
```

To enable the bridge and load the new configuration from
`/etc/network/interfaces`, run `ifreload -a`:

``` 
                   
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo ifreload -a
   
    
```

### RSTP Interoperation with MST (802.1s)

RSTP interoperates with MST seamlessly, creating a single instance of
spanning tree which transmitts BPDUs on the native VLAN. RSTP treats the
MST domain as if it were one giant switch.

## Viewing Bridge and STP Status/Logs

`mstpd` is started by default when the switch boots. `mstpd` logs and
errors are located in `/var/log/syslog`.

{{%notice warning%}}

`mstpd` is the preferred utility for interacting with STP on Cumulus
Linux. `brctl` also provides certain methods for configuring STP;
however, they are not as complete as the tools offered in `mstpd` and
[output from brctl can be
misleading](https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/212153658-brctl-showstp-Shows-Carrier-Down-Ports-as-Blocking)
in some cases.

To get the bridge state, use:

``` 
                   
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo brctl show
 bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
 br2             8000.001401010100       yes             swp1
                                                         swp4
                                                         swp5
   
    
```

To get the `mstpd` bridge state, use:

``` 
                   
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo mstpctl showbridge br2

```

To get the `mstpd` bridge port state, use:

``` 
                   
cumulus@switch:~$ sudo mstpctl showport br2

## Useful Links

The source code for `mstpd`/`mstpctl` was written by [Vitalii

## Caveats and Errata

  - MSTP is not supported currently. However, interoperability with MSTP
    networks can be accomplished using PVRSTP or PVSTP.
